### Can NLP helps with musical genre classification?

As seen in the [previous project](https://github.com/gustavolopeso/spotify-genre-classifier), audio features extracted from songs by Spotify audio analysis software can be useful to help us to differentiate brazilian Rap from brazilian Indie. But how could we improve the classifier accuracy?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a set of concepts and methods that look to make it possible for computers to understand natural human language. As rap and indie are different genres that are different in how they "sound", they are also different in **what** they talk about and **how** they do it.

Brazilian rap is a genre well known for dealing with social problems, representing the urban peripheral youth. Its lyrics protest, tell real stories, and seek to bring a motivational message to those who listen.

On the other hand, Brazilian Indie, which aggregates, in the case of this project, other genres such as New MPB and Alternative Rock, brings lyrics that deal with emotions and, to a certain extent, criticize the status quo. Many times the lyrics are not so obvious about the message they want to convey, being full of figures of speech, unlike rap, which is usually more direct.
